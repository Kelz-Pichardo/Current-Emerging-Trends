Pirate intelligent agent (key concepts in reinforcement learning and neural networks to a real-world problem)

Treasure Hunt Game: Deep Q-learning Implementation
Project Overview
In this project, I developed an intelligent agent for a treasure hunt game. The agent, represented as a pirate, uses deep Q-learning to navigate a maze environment, aiming to find the treasure in the most optimal way.

Implementation Details
Provided Code
I was provided with foundational code that set up the game's mechanics, which included:

A maze environment represented as a matrix (TreasureMaze.py).
A class to store and manage the agent's learning experiences (GameExperience.py).
A Jupyter Notebook with sample executions, visualizations, and initial agent configurations.
My Contributions
My primary responsibility was to complete the deep Q-learning implementation. I designed and integrated a neural network model that assists the pirate agent in making informed decisions. Through iterative training and refining the model's weights, the agent's decision-making abilities and game performance were significantly improved.

Reflections on Computer Science
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists leverage algorithms, systems, and software to transform complex problems into actionable solutions. In this project, I applied principles from reinforcement learning and neural networks to create an intelligent game agent. These techniques have broader applications in various sectors, from robotics to healthcare, highlighting the vast impact of computer science.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I approach challenges systematically:

Define and Understand: Grasp the problem's scope.
Decomposition: Break the problem into smaller, manageable tasks.
Development and Refinement: Use algorithms, data structures, and computational techniques to develop and iteratively refine solutions.
Testing and Validation: Ensure solutions are efficient and effective.
What are my ethical responsibilities?
To the end user: Ensure transparency, privacy, and proper functioning of software/systems.
To the organization: Produce solutions that are robust, secure, and align with the organization's objectives. Uphold data integrity, intellectual property rights, and maintain honesty in all undertakings.
